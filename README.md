# Guess the Number
"Guess the number"

 "Guess the number" is a single player game against the computer. The player thinks of an integer within 1 and a 100. If the guess is incorrect, the computer tells the player whether the guess was to high or to low. The player has a set number of attempts at guessing the correct number. If he doesnt guess correctly within the set number of tries he loses. If the player guesses correctly he wins and moves on to the next round.



### Motivation
My motivation behind this game is to create a simple, fun, and clean game. To display my unique take on the game while expanding my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Future development
What are the next steps for the project? How will you continue to evolve it?

The next steps for my project are to incorporate a timer to enhance the difficulty and user expirience. In the future I would like to incorporate a function that allows the user to set their own parameters.
