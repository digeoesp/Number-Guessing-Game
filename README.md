# Guess the Number
"Guess the number"

 "Guess the number" is a single player game against the computer. The player thinks of an integer within a known range. ... If the guess is incorrect, the computer tells the player whether the guess was too high or too low. The player has a set number of attempts at guessing the correct number. If he doesnt guess correctly within the set number of tries he looses. If the player guesses correctly he wins and moves on to the next round.



### Motivation
My motivation behind this game is to create a simple, fun, and clean game. To display my unique take on the game while expanding my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
